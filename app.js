/**
 * The code to fetch the payments data has already been written
 * for you below. To complete this group project, your group
 * will need to write code to make this app do the following:
 *
 * 1. Show the current balance based on the initial balance and
 *    any completed payments. Each completed payment will add to
 *    the balance.
 * 2. Add the payments to the table. Each payment should show
 *    the date of the payment, its status (whether is pending or
 *    complete), the description, the amount, and the balance
 *    after that payment was completed.
 *
 *    Pending payments should appear with a pink background.
 *    This can be applied by adding the `pending` class to the
 *    table row (`<tr>`) for each pending payment.
 * 3. Show what the balance will be after pending payments are
 *    completed.
 * 4. Show the total income of all payments that were received
 *    this month (May, 2019), including pending payments.
 * 5. Show the amount of the most valuable payment that was
 *    received this month (May 2019).
 * 6. For each PENDING payment, add a button that says "cancel"
 *    to the end of that payment's row. When the button is
 *    clicked, the payment should be removed from the account
 *    and the render function should be called again to update
 *    the page.
